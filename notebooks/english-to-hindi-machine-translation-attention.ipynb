After training the model one will be able to input a English sentence and get back its Hindi translation.\n\n>RNNs are also capable of doing natural language translation, aka. machine translation. It involves two RNNs, one for the source language and one for the target language. One of them is called an encoder, and the other one decoder. The reason is that, the first one encodes the sentence into a vector and the second one converts the encoded vector into a sentence in target language. The decoder is a separete RNN. Given the encoded sentence, it produces the translated sentence in target language. Attention lets the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sentence for each output word. This helps the input and output sentences to align with one another.\n\nWe obtained the dataset used from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/aiswaryaramachandran/hindienglish-corpora\n\n<h2> References: </h2>\n<li></a> Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks (Research Publication)</li>\n<li></a> https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/nmt_with_attention </li>\n<li></a> Using stochastic computation graphs formalism for optimization of sequence-to-sequence model (Research Publication) </li>\n</ul>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport string\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom string import digits\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport re\nimport logging\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.enable_eager_execution()\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\ntf.compat.v1.logging.set_verbosity(tf.compat.v1.logging.ERROR)\nlogging.getLogger('tensorflow').setLevel(logging.FATAL)\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport unicodedata\nimport io\nimport time\nimport warnings\nimport sys\n\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \nPATH = \"../input/hindienglish-corpora/Hindi_English_Truncated_Corpus.csv\"","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"/kaggle/input/hindienglish-corpora/Hindi_English_Truncated_Corpus.csv\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preprocess English and Hindi sentences"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def unicode_to_ascii(s):\n    return ''.join(c for c in unicodedata.normalize('NFD', s)\n        if unicodedata.category(c) != 'Mn')\n\ndef preprocess_sentence(w):\n    w = unicode_to_ascii(w.lower().strip())\n    w = re.sub(r\"([?.!,¿])\", r\" \\1 \", w)\n    w = re.sub(r'[\" \"]+', \" \", w)\n    w = re.sub(r\"[^a-zA-Z?.!,¿]+\", \" \", w)\n    w = w.rstrip().strip()\n    return w\n\ndef hindi_preprocess_sentence(w):\n    w = w.rstrip().strip()\n    return w","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_dataset(path=PATH):\n    lines=pd.read_csv(path,encoding='utf-8')\n    lines=lines.dropna()\n    lines = lines[lines['source']=='ted']\n    en = []\n    hd = []\n    for i, j in zip(lines['english_sentence'], lines['hindi_sentence']):\n        en_1 = [preprocess_sentence(w) for w in i.split(' ')]\n        en_1.append('<end>')\n        en_1.insert(0, '<start>')\n        hd_1 = [hindi_preprocess_sentence(w) for w in j.split(' ')]\n        hd_1.append('<end>')\n        hd_1.insert(0, '<start>')\n        en.append(en_1)\n        hd.append(hd_1)\n    return hd, en","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def max_length(tensor):\n    return max(len(t) for t in tensor)","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Tokenization of the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def tokenize(lang):\n  lang_tokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(filters='')\n  lang_tokenizer.fit_on_texts(lang)\n  tensor = lang_tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(lang)\n  tensor = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(tensor,padding='post')\n  return tensor, lang_tokenizer","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def load_dataset(path=PATH):\n    targ_lang, inp_lang = create_dataset(path)\n    input_tensor, inp_lang_tokenizer = tokenize(inp_lang)\n    target_tensor, targ_lang_tokenizer = tokenize(targ_lang)\n    return input_tensor, target_tensor, inp_lang_tokenizer, targ_lang_tokenizer","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"input_tensor, target_tensor, inp_lang, targ_lang = load_dataset(PATH)\nmax_length_targ, max_length_inp = max_length(target_tensor), max_length(input_tensor)","execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create Train and Test dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"input_tensor_train, input_tensor_val, target_tensor_train, target_tensor_val = train_test_split(input_tensor, target_tensor, test_size=0.2)\nprint(len(input_tensor_train), len(target_tensor_train), len(input_tensor_val), len(target_tensor_val))","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"71904 71904 17977 17977\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert(lang, tensor):\n  for t in tensor:\n    if t!=0:\n      print (\"%d ----> %s\" % (t, lang.index_word[t]))\n    \nprint (\"Input Language;

Both the parts are practically two different neural network models combined into one giant network. the task of an encoder network is to understand the input sequence, and create a smaller dimensional representation of it. This representation is then forwarded to a decoder network which generates a sequence of its own that represents the output. The input is put through an encoder model which gives us the encoder output. Here, each input words is assigned a weight by the attention mechanism which is then used by the decoder to predict the next word in the sentence. We use Bahdanau attention for the encoder.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Encoder"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):\n  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, enc_units, batch_sz):\n    super(Encoder, self).__init__()\n    self.batch_sz = batch_sz\n    self.enc_units = enc_units\n    self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n    self.gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(self.enc_units,\n                                   return_sequences=True,\n                                   return_state=True,\n                                   recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')\n\n  def call(self, x, hidden):\n    x = self.embedding(x)\n    output, state = self.gru(x, initial_state = hidden)\n    return output, state\n\n  def initialize_hidden_state(self):\n    return tf.zeros((self.batch_sz, self.enc_units))\n\nencoder = Encoder(vocab_inp_size, embedding_dim, units, BATCH_SIZE)","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Attention Mechanism"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class BahdanauAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):\n  def __init__(self, units):\n    super(BahdanauAttention, self).__init__()\n    self.W1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)\n    self.W2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)\n    self.V = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)\n\n  def call(self, query, values):\n    hidden_with_time_axis = tf.expand_dims(query, 1)\n    score = self.V(tf.nn.tanh(\n        self.W1(values) + self.W2(hidden_with_time_axis)))\n    attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(score, axis=1)\n    context_vector = attention_weights * values\n    context_vector = tf.reduce_sum(context_vector, axis=1)\n    return context_vector, attention_weights","execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Decoder"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):\n  def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, dec_units, batch_sz):\n    super(Decoder, self).__init__()\n    self.batch_sz = batch_sz\n    self.dec_units = dec_units\n    self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n    self.gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(self.dec_units,\n                                   return_sequences=True,\n                                   return_state=True,\n                                   recurrent_initializer='glorot_uniform')\n    self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)\n    self.attention = BahdanauAttention(self.dec_units)\n\n  def call(self, x, hidden, enc_output):\n    context_vector, attention_weights = self.attention(hidden, enc_output)\n    x = self.embedding(x)\n    x = tf.concat([tf.expand_dims(context_vector, 1), x], axis=-1)\n    output, state = self.gru(x)\n    output = tf.reshape(output, (-1, output.shape[2]))\n    x = self.fc(output)\n    return x, state, attention_weights\n\ndecoder = Decoder(vocab_tar_size, embedding_dim, units, BATCH_SIZE)","execution_count":20,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Optimizer"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\nloss_object = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(\n    from_logits=True, reduction='none')\n\ndef loss_function(real, pred):\n  mask = tf.math.logical_not(tf.math.equal(real, 0))\n  loss_ = loss_object(real, pred)\n  mask = tf.cast(mask, dtype=loss_.dtype)\n#   print(type(mask))\n  loss_ *= mask\n  return tf.reduce_mean(loss_)","execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'\ncheckpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, \"ckpt\")\ncheckpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer,\n                                 encoder=encoder,\n                                 decoder=decoder)","execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training\n\n>1.
